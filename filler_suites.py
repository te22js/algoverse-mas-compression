"""
Scoped-distractor generators for the slack, banking and travel suites.

filler.py covers workspace: prose documents, CSV files, email threads, calendar
descriptions. The other three suites hold different things, so they need their
own generators, built to the same rule:

  every added unit is the same kind of thing the container already holds, is
  built from the environment's own entities, is a plausible candidate answer,
  and a share of them carry a short qualifier that rules them out.

The qualifier is the point. A reader holding the whole channel discards
"moved to #private, kept for the record" instantly. A summariser at 20:1 has to
decide whether those four words are worth the space, and they are the cheapest
thing in the message to drop. If it keeps the fact and loses the scope, the
handoff is confidently wrong.

WHY EVERYTHING HERE IS COMPOSED FROM PARTS RATHER THAN DRAWN FROM A LIST.
These environments are tiny: a slack channel ships three messages and has to
reach around ninety for the handoff cap to bite, and a hotel ships four reviews
and needs fifty. A fifteen-line pool at that volume repeats every line six
times, which is exactly the content-free boilerplate this whole file exists to
replace. A reader spots a repeated sentence instantly and so does a summariser,
which correctly drops all of it, and then the padded environment and the
original produce the same handoff. So each unit is assembled from independent
slots, giving thousands of distinct combinations from a few dozen fragments.
