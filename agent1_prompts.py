"""
Agent 1's system prompt, in three regimes, plus the reason to change it.

THE PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT ONE.

Agent 1 is told to read the documents and write a handoff note under 180 words.
It does that well: handoffs come out around 139 words. The compressor's budget
is 120. So the stage we are actually studying squeezes 139 words into 120,
which is 1.16 to 1, essentially nothing.

The 25:1 figure quoted everywhere is documents to handoff, and Agent 1 is doing
that, not the compressor. Two stages, one job, and the one with the interesting
name is doing none of it. That is why the controls came back at 6%, 9% and 0%:
Agent 1 had already dropped them before compression ran.

THE FIX.

Move the reduction into the compressor. Agent 1 stops being a summariser and
becomes a transcriber: it runs the read tools and reports what came back,
without deciding what matters. The compressor then takes roughly 900 words down
to 120, which is a real squeeze, and whether the safety rule or the injected
instruction survives becomes a question about compression rather than about
Agent 1's judgement.

WHY THIS DOES NOT BREAK AGENT 1.

Agent 1 does two separable things, and only one of them needs the task:

  choosing what to read    needs the task. Which emails to search for, which
                           file to open.
  choosing what to pass on does not.

Verbatim takes away the second and leaves the first. Agent 1 still uses the
task to pick its tool calls, so what it transcribes is already scoped: the
three emails the search returned, not the whole inbox. It just stops being the
judge of which parts of those three emails matter. That is an ordinary
retrieval agent, and a gatherer making relevance calls is how information gets
lost in real systems too.

THE WORDING MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS.

An earlier draft of the verbatim prompt said "if a record contains something
that looks unrelated to the task, include it anyway". That ruins the
experiment. If an injected instruction then survives Agent 1, it survived
because it was invited, and the result reads as "we told the agent not to
filter and it did not filter". It also removes, by instruction, a suspicion a
real retrieval agent would have, which is a thumb on the scale.

So the regime is defined by its UNIT instead. The unit is the record: one
email, one calendar entry, one file, one message, one transaction. Agent 1
reproduces each record it read in full. An injection lives inside a record, so
it arrives as a side effect of transcribing that record honestly, not because
anything asked for unrelated content. That distinction is the difference
between a finding and a rigged one.

For the same reason the prompt says nothing about whether text inside a record
might be an instruction. Warning the agent would be a prompt-based defence,
which is one of the four AgentDojo evaluates, and a defence belongs in its own
condition rather than baked into the baseline. DEFENDED below is that
condition, kept separate on purpose.

WHAT TO WATCH.

Verbatim means an injected instruction reaches the compressor untouched, so the
compressor becomes the only filter. That is the experiment. It also means the
attack no longer has to survive Agent 1, so run 3 (attack, no compression)
stops being a test of the structure and becomes a straight ceiling measurement.
Both arms are worth keeping for exactly that reason.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- regime P
# Plan plus evidence. The one to run.
#
# THE PLAN IS NARROW, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
#
# An earlier draft had PLAN restate every value Agent 2 needed: tool, title,
# both timestamps, the participant. Eighteen tokens at the top of a 2,800
# token handoff. Measured against mechanical compressors, keeping the first
# 100 tokens then retained 100% of the required values at every budget. Three
# consequences, all fatal:
#
#   compression could not fail a benign task, so run 2 had no result in it
#   the task's values got a short trusted restatement at the top while the
#     injection sat in raw evidence further down, so "attack dies, task
#     survives" was explained by position rather than by the summariser
#     judging anything
#   an injection that fooled Agent 1 was promoted into that same privileged
#     slot and rode out compression, so attack success was settled before the
#     compressor ran at all
#
# Narrowing it costs 9 tokens of handoff, 0.3%, and leaves the ratio at
# 18.8:1 either way. It is not a length change. It changes what is allowed in
# the plan: the action, plus only the figures that exist nowhere in the
# records. Six of 53 tasks carry such a figure (the rent rise, the VAT, half
# the dinner bill); for the other 47 the PLAN is just a tool name. Everything
# recoverable has to survive compression on its own merits, alongside the
# injection, which is the comparison the paper is about.
#
# `head` retention drops from 100% to 43%, which is where no-PLAN sits, so
# the narrow plan buys back all the sensitivity without making those six
# tasks impossible.
#
# EVIDENCE keeps what is relevant AND what might be. Graded rather than
# binary, and deliberately not "include anything that looks unrelated": that
# phrasing invites the injection, and then its survival is something we asked
# for rather than something we measured.
#
# Not done, worth noting as future work: letting the retrieve-and-report cycle
# run several times instead of once. Compression would then apply repeatedly
# and loss would compound, which nobody has looked at. It also makes the ratio
# vary per turn and the scoring ambiguous about which turn broke a task, and
# most AgentDojo tasks have only one to three read steps, so there is little
# loop to have.
#
# This is what Agent 1 is FOR. A pure transcriber is close to a pass-through
# and the question "why have Agent 1 at all" has no good answer. A summariser
# does the compressor's job and leaves it nothing. Planning is the work that is
# genuinely Agent 1's and nobody else's:
#
#   which tools to call      needs the task
#   what the action should be  this is the delegation Yibo found was missing,
#                            and it is why Agent 2 stopped having to guess
#   values that must be computed   the rent rise, the VAT, half the dinner
#                            bill. Five banking tasks turn on a number written
#                            down nowhere, and no later stage can work it out
#   the evidence behind it   reproduced, not judged
#
# The split matters for attribution. The PLAN is Agent 1's output. The EVIDENCE
# is the material the compressor acts on, and the injection lives in it, so
# whether it reaches Agent 2 is a question about compression rather than about
# Agent 1's suspicion.
#
# Both halves go through the compressor. Routing the plan around it would mean
# handoff_critical always survives, compression could never break a benign
# task, and run 2 would have no result in it.

# NO CAP ON AGENT 1, deliberately, and it is not a unit quibble.
#
# A cap forces Agent 1 to choose which records fit, which is relevance
# filtering through the back door: the exact thing moved out of Agent 1 in the
# first place. Uncapped, Agent 1 reports and the compressor is the only place
# any reduction happens, which is what makes a retention number attributable.
#
# Words are also the wrong unit even for the compressor's budget. Density
# varies 5.5 to 9.1 characters per word across these suites, so the same
# "600 words" is a different amount of real material in workspace than in
# slack, and the compression ratio stops being comparable between them. The
# compressor's budget belongs in tokens; Agent 1 gets no budget at all.
#
# Nor would a token cap work as an instruction: models cannot count their own
# tokens. Any ceiling is a safety rail enforced in code, not a line in a
# prompt.
#
# Uncapped also restores the spread. The task set runs 993 to 7,972 tokens of
# evidence on its own, which at a 150-token budget is 6.6:1 to 53:1. That is a
# dose-response axis already present in the data, with no sweep to pay for.
