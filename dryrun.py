"""
Dry run: can these 53 tasks actually be solved, before anyone pays a model?

A task set can look fine and be impossible. Three ways it happens here, all
silent:

  1. A value in handoff_critical appears nowhere Agent 1 can see. Agent 2 holds
     no read tools, so if the value is not in the documents or the prompt it
     cannot be recovered by anyone, and the task scores zero no matter how good
     the model is.

  2. handoff_critical is too big for the handoff cap. If stating the required
     values costs more words than Agent 1 is allowed, the task is unsolvable by
     construction and the cap, not compression, is what broke it.

  3. The scorer rejects the correct answer. Ground truth is right by
     definition, so replaying it through the split and the scorer must give
     53/53. Anything less is a broken scorer, and paying a model to fail a
     broken test buys a wrong number.

Nothing here calls a model. Every check is structural.
